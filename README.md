# KMeans
In this code, we create a simple customer dataset with 'Age' and 'Income' columns and perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering with k=3 clusters.
We visualize the clusters, calculate cluster statistics, and discuss strategies based on the cluster characteristics. 
However, for a real-world project, you would need to further analyze and refine your strategies and perform evaluations to determine their effectiveness.
